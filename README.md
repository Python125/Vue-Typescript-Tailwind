This project is a web-based mock-up of the Ollivander's Wand Shop from the Harry Potter universe, allowing users to browse and "purchase" character-themed wands. It was built as a personal project to explore the Vue.js framework, Tailwind CSS for styling, and TypeScript for type-safe JavaScript. By developing this application, I gained hands-on experience with Vue.js and expanded my knowledge of front-end JavaScript frameworks, working with components, data handling, and interactive features.

As a budding developer interested in learning Vue.js, I created this project to deepen my understanding of modern JavaScript frameworks and see how Vue.js facilitates building a single-page application. Vue.js components allowed me to modularize each part of the app, making it easy to build, manage, and scale. Additionally, by incorporating TypeScript, I aimed to write cleaner and more robust code while benefiting from static typing.

This project was a rewarding experience, providing me with a deeper understanding of Vue.js and front-end development principles. I'm excited to continue refining my skills and exploring the world of Vue.js!

# Technologies Used
- Vue.js: For building the application structure and handling data binding.
- Tailwind CSS: For efficient, responsive styling.
- TypeScript: To add type safety to JavaScript and improve code maintainability.
