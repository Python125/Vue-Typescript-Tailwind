This project is a web-based mock-up of Ollivander's Wand Shop from the Harry Potter universe, allowing users to browse and "purchase" character-themed wands. Built as a personal project to explore Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, it served as an opportunity to deepen my understanding of modern JavaScript frameworks and experience building a single-page application. Through developing this application, I gained hands-on experience with Vue.js components, enabling me to modularize, manage, and scale each part of the app more easily. Additionally, using Tailwind CSS streamlined responsive styling, and incorporating TypeScript allowed me to write cleaner, more robust code with the benefits of static typing.

This project was a rewarding experience, providing me with a deeper understanding of Vue.js and front-end development principles. I'm excited to continue refining my skills and exploring the world of Vue.js!

# Technologies Used
- Vue.js: For building the application structure and handling data binding.
- Tailwind CSS: For efficient, responsive styling.
- TypeScript: To add type safety to JavaScript and improve code maintainability.
